			<strong>Here's what we came up with:</strong><br>
					-	Idea 1: A standalone app that secures files such as PDF uses GPS for locational authentication. <br>
					-	Idea 2: A library app that enables users to read reference documents within the premises of a library. Risk involved is that Server may not scalable and trustable.<br>
					-	Idea 3: A memo pad that can only be accessed at the workplace. Again, it would be a risk if servers are not scalable and trustable.<br>
					-	Idea 4: Location based student attendance system for schools.<br>
					-	Data recovery could be done through setting a secure data recovery location or by answering password recover challenge questions.<br>
